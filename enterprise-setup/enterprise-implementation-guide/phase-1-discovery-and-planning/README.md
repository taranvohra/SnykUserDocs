# Phase 1: Discovery and planning

## Discovery phase steps

* [Connect with Snyk](connect-with-snyk.md): Connecting with your Snyk account manager.
* [Conduct discovery](conduct-discovery.md): Identifying stakeholders, integrations, and applications to monitor.
* [Plan Organization structure](plan-organization-structure.md): decide how to organize and control access to content using Organization structure.
* [Determine Member roles](determine-member-roles.md): decide whether your users need customized access to Snyk.
* [Decide SSO access](decide-sso-access.md): Identify initial Single Sign-On (SSO) settings.
* [Plan for success](plan-for-success.md): decide how to judge the success of your rollout.
* [Choose rollout integrations](choose-rollout-integrations.md): decide which integrations to implement initially.
* [Create rollout plan](create-rollout-plan.md): create your high-level plan for rolling out Snyk in your business.

## General pre-rollout questions

Before starting rollout, here are some initial questions you can ask, to assist in planning - this is an alternative way of deciding your rollout planning process.

### Who's involved?

* Who will manage and oversee the project?
* Who will champion Snyk?
* Who will be the Group Administrator?

### What are your goals?

* Why did you choose Snyk?
* Why are you implementing it now?

#### How will your users use Snyk?

How will you provision users, and integrate Snyk with your platforms?

* Who will need access to Snyk?
* What will they need access to?
* Will access be restricted to certain projects?
* Who can grant Snyk access to platforms like SSO and Git Repositories?

### How will you structure your account?

* How will you group projects?
  * By developer teams?
  * By product?
  * By business unit?
* If by developer teams, are there some teams that would need access to the same projects? If yes, think about a different structure to avoid confusion.
* How many [Snyk Organizations](../../../snyk-admin/manage-groups-and-organizations/whats-a-snyk-organization.md) do you need?

### How will you measure success?

* What KPIs will be tracked?
* How will you know youâ€™re making progress?
* Are there key development projects that progress tracking should be aligned with, or at least included to measure progress against?
