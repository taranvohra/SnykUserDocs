# Enable Snyk Code

When you create a new Organization, Snyk Code (SAST) scanning is disabled by default. Snyk recommends enabling Snyk Code before you import your first Projects to Snyk. If Snyk Code is enabled after a Project is imported, Snyk will not detect Snyk Code files.

1. Select the **Settings > Snyk Code** option.
2. Click the toggle to enable Snyk Code, then click **Save changes**
