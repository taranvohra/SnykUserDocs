# Developer training from Snyk

Snyk has many resources to assist developers in their learning security and the Snyk Platform

* [Snyk Learn](https://learn.snyk.io) - teaches developers how to stay secure with interactive lessons exploring vulnerabilities across various languages and ecosystems.
* [Snyk Product training](https://learn.snyk.io/catalog/product-training/) - provides product training on the Snyk Platform. Learning paths are available for key stakeholder roles like Developers and Administrators.

## Snyk Learn

[Snyk Learn](https://snyk.io/platform/learn/) teaches developers how to stay secure with interactive lessons exploring vulnerabilities across various languages and ecosystems. The modules can be filtered by ecosystem and contain information and guidance on fixing common vulnerability types, such as **NoSQL injection attack** or **Server-side request forgery**.

These lessons are designed to improve your developersâ€™ security knowledge in a broad context, rather than being focused specifically on Snyk products or the remediation advice provided by Snyk. This means they can serve as a great introduction to developer security for less experienced teams in this area.
