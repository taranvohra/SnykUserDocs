# Install Broker for Code Agent using Docker

{% hint style="info" %}
For the first deployment of the Broker Client – Code Agent, collaborating with your Integration Consultant/Technical Success Manager or [Snyk Support](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us) is required.
{% endhint %}

The workflow for setting up the Code Agent – Broker Client components for a full deployment is as follows:

1\. [Obtain the required tokens for the setup procedure](step-1-obtaining-the-required-tokens-for-the-setup-procedure/).

2\. If you already have a running Broker Client for the same Organization and the same Integration: [Stop and remove the existing Broker Client](step-2-removing-an-existing-broker-client.md).

3\. [Create an internal network for the Code Agent – Broker Client communication](step-3-creating-a-network-for-the-broker-client-and-code-agent-communication.md).

4\. [Set up the Code Agent component](step-4-setting-up-the-code-agent/).

5\. [Set up the Broker Client component](step-5-setting-up-the-broker-client/).\
You can set up the Broker Client component with or without a display of the code snippets on the Web UI results. See [Running the Broker Client without code snippets](step-5-setting-up-the-broker-client/step-5.2a-running-the-broker-client-without-the-code-snippet-display.md) and [Running the Broker Client with code snippets](step-5-setting-up-the-broker-client/step-5.2b-running-the-broker-client-with-the-code-snippets-display.md).
