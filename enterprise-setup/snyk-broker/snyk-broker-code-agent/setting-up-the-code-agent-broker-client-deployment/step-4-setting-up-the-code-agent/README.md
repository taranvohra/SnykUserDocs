# Step 4: Setting up the Code Agent

Setup of the Code Agent includes the following steps:

[Downloading or updating the Docker image of the Code Agent](step-4.1-downloading-or-updating-the-code-agent-docker-image.md).\
It is highly recommended to pull and use the `latest` Docker image version.

[Running the Code Agent container based on the downloaded Docker image](step-4.2-running-the-code-agent-container.md).

If you are using a proxy server, see also [Setting up the Code Agent to work with a Proxy Server](setting-up-the-code-agent-to-work-with-a-proxy-server.md).
