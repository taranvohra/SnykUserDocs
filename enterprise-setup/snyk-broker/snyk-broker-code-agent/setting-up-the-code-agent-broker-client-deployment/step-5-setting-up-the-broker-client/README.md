# Step 5: Setting up the Broker Client

{% hint style="info" %}
**Before you start** â€“ make sure that you currently do not have a running Broker Client for the same Snyk Organization and the same SCM. If you do have a running Broker Client, [stop and remove it](../step-2-removing-an-existing-broker-client.md).
{% endhint %}

Setup of the Broker Client begins with [downloading or updating the Docker image of the Broker Client](step-5.1-downloading-or-updating-the-snyk-broker-client-docker-image.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
The Code Agent is supported only in Broker Client version 4.108.0 and later versions. If you are already using the Docker image of the Broker Client, pull the latest update.
{% endhint %}

Setup continues with running the Broker Client container based on the downloaded Docker image.

You can [run the Broker Client WITHOUT a display of the code snippets in the Snyk Code results on the Web UI](step-5.2a-running-the-broker-client-without-the-code-snippet-display.md):
