# Insights setup: User permissions

Currently, Insights is available at the Group level, so [grant relevant users the Group viewer role](../../../snyk-admin/manage-permissions-and-roles/manage-member-roles.md#edit-a-role). This is the minimum required permission, but Group Admins also can view Insights.

After users have the right permission, they will see a new **Insights** option in the left navigation at the Group level.
