# How Snyk handles your data

Snyk is a developer security platform, and thus Snyk places the utmost importance on data security. Fully understanding your privacy and security needs, Snyk provides this document with the goal of providing you with transparency as to how and what data is accessed, transferred, and stored by Snyk.

The data handled by Snyk varies depending on the product you are using, how you are integrating with Snyk and your Snyk deployment. Because Snyk is subject to fast-moving changes, the types of data accessed and stored might change with the introduction of a new capability or changes to an existing capability.

## Flexible deployment options

Snyk leverages the latest software development practices and technologies to provide customers with the flexibility to use Snyk’s developer security platform in the manner that best suits the needs of their business.

Snyk’s cloud-first deployment options offer ease of use and scalability while also providing the required level of data protection with multi- and single-tenancy options supported in the US, EU, and AUS. Additional regions will be supported in the future.

* **Multi-Tenant SaaS**: The simplest, most common, and most cost-effective way to use Snyk’s developer security platform
* **Single-Tenant SaaS:** Private Cloud - An isolated and fully managed instance of the Snyk developer security platform on AWS. For details, see [Snyk Deployment Options](https://snyk.io/platform/deployment-options/).
* **Snyk Broker**: A client service installed on your private infrastructure, acting as a proxy between the Snyk developer security platform (multi- or single-tenant) and your on-premise codebase. [Snyk Broker](../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/) securely handles inbound and outbound connections, encrypting data during transit and deliberately controlling the access Snyk has to your data. Sensitive credentials stay behind your firewall.

**Be sure to reach out to your Snyk contact for more details on how these different options can be leveraged to meet your needs.**

## Customer data flows across Snyk

Snyk provides a wide range of development tools and integration points, requiring different types of data and involving different data interactions. The sections that follow provide an overview of both the common types of data Snyk accesses and stores and product and integration-specific types. The information is reviewed at least twice per year or when a significant change occurs within the product operations.

## Common data types

* **Vulnerability data** - Snyk stores information on the vulnerabilities identified in customer applications and related fix context.
* **Vulnerability source** - Snyk stores information on where the vulnerability was identified. Examples: source code repository or registry, file name and location, dependency tree, vulnerability path.
* **Integration-related data** - Snyk stores information required to set up an integration with Snyk. Examples: tokens and configurations.
* **User data** - Snyk stores user information required to access and use the platform. Examples: user name, IDs (for example, GitHub user ID), email address, IP address.
* **User list** - For purposes of accurate contributor counting, Snyk accesses commits from the last 90 days for repositories monitored. Upon request, an unhashed version of user emails is produced.
* **Billing data** - Snyk stores information required for billing your Snyk account.
* **User behavior analytics** - Snyk stores various types of information pertaining to usage patterns. Examples: platform navigation and executed CLI commands.

## Product-specific data types

Snyk knows how important it is for you to protect your data. Snyk products only access and store the information needed to provide you with Snyk services and to ensure accurate analysis.

* For the Reachable Vulnerabilities feature - Snyk will access and store the contents of your git repository to facilitate the building of a call graph. When the analysis completes, your code is deleted from the Snyk system. Only the call graph and function names are maintained.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Snyk Code" %}
#### **Snyk Code**

![Snyk Code](../.gitbook/assets/SnykCode.svg)

* Snyk accesses your repository code for a one-time analysis, caching it for up to 12 hours. After this period, only the location (file path, line, and column) of the issues found, the issue id, and explanations are maintained. Your code is removed and is not stored in the Snyk network or logs.
* Results are stored in a database and used for analytic and monitoring purposes by Snyk.
* When you are viewing Snyk Code issue details on the Snyk Web UI, note that the associated files are loaded and cached for up to 12 hours.
* Snyk Code does not use any customer code (1) for engine training purposes or (2) to extract examples to show possible fixes.
* The AI model for Snyk Code Fix Suggestions is trained on public repositories with permissive licenses, where any data from repositories with changing licenses are immediately removed. Static analysis, automated assessment, and partial human labeling are used during the data collection.
* The scan results do not contain original source code but rather pointers to positions (for example, files, line, and column numbers), plus identification meta-information so that results are displayed using the correct source code version.
* Snyk stores repository-specific information. Examples: Name of the Git repository and file names.
* The server infrastructure ensures separation between customers by using authentication and authorization. Snyk Code uses software controls to ensure customer data segregation. All communication is encrypted using high-grade industry-standard protocols.

## Snyk integrations: Git repository cloning

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is in open beta for GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, Bitbucket Server, Bitbucket Cloud App, Bitbucket Cloud (Legacy), and Azure Repos integrations.
{% endhint %}

Full Git repository cloning allows Snyk to provide more reliable and accurate results when scanning your source code through the [SCM integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations), helping you develop fast and stay secure.

### How Git cloning supports more reliable results

Traditionally, Snyk has accessed repository contents using SCM APIs, which impose primary and secondary rate limits, and content limits. For example, the GitHub.com APIs are rate-limited to allow only a certain number of requests per hour, and there is a limit on the number of tree entries that can be retrieved from the Git database.

When repository contents are retrieved over these APIs, these limitations inhibit Snyk’s providing a complete analysis in a number of ways, especially across a very large number of repositories, or for repositories containing more than 100,000 files, sometimes referred to as monorepos.

Through cloning, these limitations are removed.

### How Git cloning supports more accurate results

The accuracy of results is improved in a number of ways through cloning. Since Snyk can access a complete view of a source code repository at a specific commit SHA, including repositories containing more than 100,000 files, the analysis is also more complete through cloning.

### Snyk data ingestion

When Git repository cloning is enabled, Snyk will ingest, through configured SCM integrations, a temporary snapshot of repository contents at a given commit and all commit metadata (including the commit message, authors, and timestamp).

### How Snyk processes this data

Snyk uses cloud products from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to process and store the data in a cache.

Data is cached up to 48 hours “per commit”, meaning that for every commit pushed to a repository that Snyk is tracking, the contents of that commit will be held in a cache for up to 48 hours. Multiple commits within a single 48-hour period will result in multiple caches with their own 48-hour lifecycle. At the end of each 48-hour lifecycle, the cache is automatically deleted according to cloud provider policies.

### Safeguards Snyk puts in place to ensure data is secure

* Snyk will perform a clone only when an SCM integration flow requires it, for example, PR check, import, and test.
* Communication between the cloning service and cache is encrypted with TLS 1.2.
* Cloned assets are deleted from the file system immediately after populating the cache.
* The cache for a clone is deleted after a maximum of 48 hours.
* All data is handled by Snyk in accordance with the SOC 2 standard. For more details, see [Snyk certifications](how-snyk-handles-your-data.md#snyk-certifications).
* Your data is analyzed only for the purposes of improving code security and code quality and in accordance with your Data Processing Addendum.

### Git repository cloning protocols

Repositories are cloned using HTTPS. SSH-based clones are currently unavailable.

### Flows used in Git repository cloning

[PR checks](../scan-using-snyk/run-pr-checks/), [import](../getting-started/quickstart/import-a-project.md), and r[ecurring tests](../scan-using-snyk/working-with-snyk-in-your-environment/running-scans.md) will all make use of Git repository cloning for all Projects imported using an SCM integration.

### Snyk Broker interactions

Brokered connections are supported when Git operations are allowed through Broker.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This will override restrictions from `accept.json`. For more information, see [Clone capability with Broker for Docker](../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/install-and-configure-snyk-broker/advanced-configuration-for-snyk-broker-docker-installation/snyk-code-clone-capability-with-broker-for-docker.md).
{% endhint %}
