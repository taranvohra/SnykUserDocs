# Predefined predicates and templates

## Predicates

### Any

A "catchall" rule. Matches on anything.

### AnySource

Matches on various types of potentially user-controlled data sources, both servers, for example, HTTP parameters/header/body, URLs, cookies, and so on, or indirect ones such as database fields, local files, I/O, or environment variables.

### DeserializationSanitizer

Matches on deserialization sanitizers.

### DeserializationSink

Matches on deserialization sinks.

### None

An "anti-catchall" rule. Matches on nothing.

### PTSanitizer

Matches on path-traversal sanitizers.

### PtSink

Matches on path-traversal sinks.

### SourceArchive

Matches on reading values that are coming from zip, tar, or other archives.

### SourceCLI

Matches on reading command line arguments.

### SourceClientFramework

Matches on reading values that are coming from a client-side framework such as Android, SwiftUI, UIKit, or the DOM of an HTML page.

### SourceCookie

Matches on reading values of cookies on an http server. These values are of security interest because they can be fully controlled by malicious users.

### SourceDatabase

Matches on reading values that are coming from a database.

### SourceEnvironmentVariable

Matches on reading environment variables of a process.

### SourceFile

Matches on reading values that are coming from files.

### SourceHttpBody

Matches on reading the http request body on an http server. These values are of security interest because they may be fully controlled by malicious actors.

### SourceHttpFileUpload

Matches on the name and content of the file uploaded to an http server. These values are of security interest because they may be fully controlled by malicious actors.

### SourceHttpHeader

Matches on reading values of http headers on a server. These values are of security interest because they may be fully controlled by malicious actors.

### SourceHttpParam

Matches on reading values of http parameters on an http server. These values are of security interest because they may be fully controlled by malicious actors.

### SourceLocalEnv

Matches on reading values from the local environment of the running process. This includes command line arguments, standard input, or environment variables.

### SourceNonServer

Matches on reading values that may be controlled by an adversary but not directly by sending requests to a server. For example, if an application fetches a value from a URL, an adversary in control of that URL may use it to control its content.

### SourceRequestUrl

Matches on reading request URLs on a server. The URLs are of security interest because they may be fully controlled by malicious actors.

### SourceResourceAccess

Matches on reading values that may be controlled by an adversary if they gain access to a resource. The resources this matches are remote URLs, files, database fields, or other framework-specific cases such as Android intents.

### SourceRpcApiParam

Matches on parameters of RPCs implemented in an RPC server. These values are of security interest because they may be fully controlled by malicious actors.

### SourceServer

Matches on reading values that an attacker can send to a server. Examples are http parameters/header/body, URLs, or cookies. Since these may be directly controllable by attackers, these sources are of significant security interest.

### SourceStdin

Matches on reading input from the standard input of a process.

### SourceWebForm

Matches on reading values of web forms in a web server. These values are of security interest because they may be fully controlled by malicious actors.

### SqliSanitizer

Matches on SQL injection sanitizers.

### SqliSink

Matches on SQL injection sinks.

### SsrfSanitizer

Matches on SSRF sanitizers.

### SsrfSink

Matches on SSRF sinks.

### XssSanitizer

Matches on XSS sanitizers.

### XssSink

Matches on XSS sinks.

<details>

<summary>Example</summary>

```java
package snippets.java.docs;

public class HasAnnotationDemo {
    public void oldMethod(@Deprecated String parameter1, String parameter2) {

    }
}
```

To capture `parameter1`, use the following query:

```
HasAnnotation<"java.lang.Deprecated">
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Example (named parameters)</summary>

```java
package snippets.java.docs;

import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

@Target({ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.METHOD})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@interface Sensitive {
    String reason();
}


public class HasAnnotationWithArgsDemo {
    private String email = "support@snyk.io";

    @Sensitive(reason = "PII")
    public String getEmail() {
        return email;
    }
}
```

To capture the `getEmail` method, use the following query:

```
HasAnnotation<And<"Sensitive", HasNamedArg<"reason", "PII">>>
```

</details>

{% hint style="warning" %}
`HasAnnotation` can not be used within `Taint` workflows yet.
{% endhint %}

### HasAnyArg

        check.method("sample2", "sample3", "sample1");
    }
}
```
