# Breakdown of code analysis

The **Code Analysis** page displays the results of the Snyk Code test for a specific repository. These results are all the vulnerability issues that Snyk Code discovered in the source code of the imported repository:

The **Code Analysis** page consists of several areas:

* [Header](code-analysis-page-header.md) - includes the details of the imported repository with a link to the repository in the SCM, the Project name, and the Projects tabs: **Overview**, **History**, and **Settings**.
* [The Project Summary Information area](https://github.com/taranvohra/SnykDocs/blob/main/docs/scan-using-snyk/snyk-code/exploring-and-working-with-snyk-code-results-in-the-web-ui/exploring-the-code-analysis-page/broken-reference/README.md) - includes the dates of the repository import and the last test of the repository, the **Retest now** option for a manual test, the name of the user who imported the repository, the name of the Project owner, and the number of code files that were analyzed and not analyzed.
* [The filter pane](https://github.com/taranvohra/SnykDocs/blob/main/docs/scan-using-snyk/snyk-code/exploring-and-working-with-snyk-code-results-in-the-web-ui/exploring-the-code-analysis-page/broken-reference/README.md) - includes a set of pre-defined criteria for filtering the displayed issues.
* [The vulnerability issues area](code-analysis-page-vulnerability-issues-area.md) - includes the vulnerability issues that Snyk Code discovered in the imported repository.
* [**Data flow** page](https://github.com/taranvohra/SnykDocs/blob/main/docs/scan-using-snyk/snyk-code/exploring-and-working-with-snyk-code-results-in-the-web-ui/exploring-the-code-analysis-page/broken-reference/README.md) - displays the taint flow of the issue in the code.
* [**Fix analysis** page](exploring-the-fix-analysis-page.md) - provides additional details about the discovered vulnerability type, best practices for preventing this issue, and code examples of fixes.
