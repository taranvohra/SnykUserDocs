# Scan code

You can scan your code using Snyk Code:

* In the [Snyk Web UI](../../../getting-started/explore-snyk-through-the-web-ui.md) (including [PR checks](../../run-pr-checks/))
* With your [IDE](../../../integrate-with-snyk/ide-tools/)
* Through the [Snyk CLI](../../../snyk-cli/)
* Through [Snyk API](../../../snyk-api/)

## Prerequisites for using Snyk Code in the Web UI

Before scanning your code with Snyk Code, ensure you:

* Have completed the [quickstart](../../../getting-started/quickstart/) steps.
* Your repositories contain code in a supported language and platform. See [Introduction to Snyk-supported languages and frameworks](../../supported-languages-and-frameworks/introduction-to-snyk-supported-languages-and-frameworks.md).
* [Activate Snyk Code using the Web UI](activate-snyk-code-using-the-web-ui.md).
