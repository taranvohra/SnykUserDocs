# Snyk Code deployment

You can deploy Snyk Code in several ways:

## Full SaaS solution

Get the most out of Snyk Code with a native SCM integration, easy onboarding, and continuous updates.\
See [Getting started with Snyk Code](../scan-code/activate-snyk-code-using-the-web-ui.md).

## SaaS with a self-hosted Git server (requires Snyk Broker)

For customers with SCMs that are not publicly accessible from the internet and want to connect Snyk Code with their local self-hosted SCM.\
See [Snyk Broker - Code Agent](../../../enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/snyk-broker-code-agent/).

## Local no-upload implementation (requires Snyk Code Local Engine)

For customers with a more strict upload policy. This deployment method requires more maintenance and receives slower updates than the SaaS options, but it does not require any code upload.\
See [Snyk Code Local Engine](snyk-code-local-engine.md).
