## Getting started with Snyk for Swift and Objective-C language across environments

### Snyk CLI

#### **Prerequisites for CLI for Swift and CocoaPods**

1. [Create a Snyk account](../../getting-started/quickstart/create-or-log-in-to-a-snyk-account.md)
2. [Install Snyk CLI and authenticate your machine](../../snyk-cli/getting-started-with-the-snyk-cli.md#install-the-snyk-cli-and-authenticate-your-machine)
3. [Set the default Organization for all Snyk tests](https://github.com/taranvohra/SnykDocs/blob/main/docs/scan-applications/supported-languages-and-frameworks/broken-reference/README.md) (code analysis)

#### Code analysis

To start testing your code using Snyk Code open your repository in a terminal and run the following command:

```javascript
snyk code test
```

To customize test options, run other commands, exclude directories and files, and explore the results in different formats, see the following:

* [Snyk CLI commands](../../snyk-cli/commands/#available-commands)
* [Exclude directories and files from the Snyk tests](../../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/using-snyk-code-from-the-cli/excluding-directories-and-files-from-the-snyk-code-cli-test.md)
* [Explore test results in a JSON or SARIF format in the terminal](https://github.com/taranvohra/SnykDocs/blob/main/docs/scan-applications/supported-languages-and-frameworks/broken-reference/README.md)
* [Exporting the test results to a JSON or SARIF file](https://github.com/taranvohra/SnykDocs/blob/main/docs/scan-applications/supported-languages-and-frameworks/broken-reference/README.md)

#### Open source and licensing

The way Snyk analyzes and builds the dependency tree varies depending on the language and package manager of the Project.

After Snyk has built the tree, Snyk uses the vulnerability database to find vulnerabilities in any packages in the dependency tree.

### Snyk integrations

:link: For integrated development environments, see [Use Snyk in your IDE](../../integrate-with-snyk/ide-tools/).

:link: If you prefer continuous integration/continuous delivery workflows, you can scan with Snyk based on the integration with your automation software (see [Snyk CI/CD](../../integrate-with-snyk/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/) and [Snyk API](../../snyk-api/)).
