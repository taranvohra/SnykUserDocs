{% endhint %}

Permissions are granted to users according to their role.

Snyk Enterprise plan customers can [manage member roles](manage-member-roles.md) and [change the permissions (role) of a user](change-the-permissions-role-of-a-user.md) in the Snyk Web UI or [update member roles using the Snyk API v1](update-member-roles-via-api.md).

When you create or edit a role as explained on the page [Manage Member Roles](manage-member-roles.md), the Web UI displays a list of permissions you can associate with each role. For more information about these permissions, see the page [Permissions associated with each pre-defined role](permissions-associated-with-each-pre-defined-role.md).

There are many considerations involved in managing Member Roles. See these sections on the [Manage Member Roles](manage-member-roles.md) page:

* [Permissions (role) required to edit Project attributes from the Snyk CLI](manage-member-roles.md#permissions-role-required-to-edit-project-attributes-from-the-snyk-cli)
* [Things to remember in working with Member Roles](manage-member-roles.md#things-to-remember-in-working-with-member-roles)
