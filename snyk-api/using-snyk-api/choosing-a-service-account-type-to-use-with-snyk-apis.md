# Choosing a service account type to use with Snyk APIs

For certain Snyk API calls you must authenticate using an Organization or Group service account.

For example, use a Group service account token to call Group API endpoints and Organization API endpoints for all Organizations in the Group. For more information see [Service account introduction](https://docs.snyk.io/features/user-and-group-management/structure-account-for-high-application-performance/service-accounts#introduction).

The Snyk API uses the same roles as the Snyk Web UI applications. Each Snyk action requires a set of user permissions to be present. See [Managing permissions](https://docs.snyk.io/features/user-and-group-management/managing-users-and-permissions/managing-permissions) for the mapping of permissions for roles.
