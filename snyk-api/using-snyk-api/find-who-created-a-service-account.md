# Find who created a service account

To find who created an Org-level or Group-level service account, use API v1 [Get group level audit logs](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/audit-logs/group-level-audit-logs/get-group-level-audit-logs) or and [Get organization level audit logs](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/audit-logs/organization-level-audit-logs/get-organization-level-audit-logs) to find the event that shows service account creation, deletion, or edit.
