# View test results in HTML format

After you use `snyk-to-htm`l to generate an HTML file containing your test results, you can view the results in your browser.

To view the HTML file, locate the output file in your repository and double-click it. The following example shows a `results.html` file.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Snyk-to-HTML - Results file.png" alt="results.html file in the repository"><figcaption><p><code>results.html</code> file in the repository</p></figcaption></figure>

If you used a different name for your HTML file, locate and open that file.

The test results report opens in the browser. The following example shows `snyk code test` results.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/Snyk-to-HTML - HTML Report - 2.png" alt="Snyk Code Report"><figcaption><p>Snyk Code Report</p></figcaption></figure>

You can view the **Data Flow** and **Fix Analysis** information of the discovered vulnerabilities by clicking these buttons for each issue:
